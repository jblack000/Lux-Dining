## General info

This is my first attempt at creating a restaurant webiste. Although there are many improvments that can be incorporated, there are certain functionalities that I wanted to practice implementing. Below are the site's features:

- Mobile first
- Fixed navigation bar
- Logo's font family changes when expanding site's width
- Homepage has a slideshow
- Background consists of fixed images
- Has a sprinkle of JavaScript to toggle the mobile menu
- The 'experience' webpage uses grid to overlay texts and images; changes to single column for mobile
- Uses Leaflet library to incorporate an interactive map which displays the location of Lux Dining

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JS-vanilla

## Setup

Any text editor of your choice.

This project was inspired by Toca Madera's website, which was created by BentoBox. This is a well designed site that quickly attracted my attention.
